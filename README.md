#I havn't given this project a proper name.#
##I'm tempted to call it "Ageless CMS"##

But..

##This is not a CMS.##

I was simply inspired by my brother-in-law, who was being taken advantage of by a 'website builder' to make a website where he puts his data in, and a neat, presentable website comes out.

##This is not a CMS.##

The Admin doesn't change the functionality of the site, where things are shown, etc..  They simply fill in their products, content, images, etc.. and the project does the rest.
